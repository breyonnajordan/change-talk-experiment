# An Experimental Test of Change Exposure in Civic Contexts

## Overview
Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a therapeutic technique often successfully applied in medical contexts to encourage patients to engage in pro-health behaviors, such as vaccinating children or quitting narcotics. For this project, I wanted to see if one aspect of MI, the cultivation of change talk, could be used to affect participants’ civic engagement, adding to the growing body of interdisciplinary research seeking to drive people towards actions that make the world a better place by drawing on political theory, sociology, and psychology.

I decided to design an experiment using a Qualtrics survey to determine if viewing change talk, and its inverse, sustain talk would affect participants beliefs and intentions to engage in two forms of everyday activism, signing petitions and making small donations.

My statistical modeling in R did not provide significant results, indicating that that brief exposures to change talk may not be sufficient to shift intentions, but also that exposure to sustain talk may not be able to do the same. To share these findings, I wrote a research paper, delivered a presentation, and devised a poster, all linked below.

## Data
- Responses to a survey deisgned by me and approved by a Data Professor
- 120 Wesleyan University Students
- Emails were removed to preserve anonymity

## Method
- Respondents were randomly assigned to read one of four vignettes
discussing a either petition signing or small donations, and a student’s
decision to either change their habits of not engaging or sustain their
current behavior.
- Intention to engage in everyday collective action was assessed using
two composites, one for Petitions and one for donations, which each
averaged 3 5-point Likert scales.
- Belief in the efficacy of everyday collective action was assessed using
two composites, one for Petitions and one for donations, which each
averaged 3 5-point Likert scales.
- Qualtrics was used for the survey
- Data was analyzed using R Studio

## Results
- No significant results were found.

- link to paper/poster

## Limitations
- While there was an attention check, there was no reading check. 
- This experiment cannot be used to claim that exposure to change or sustain talk has any affect on behavior, nor that it has no affect on behavior, just that exposure to either may not have an effect or may not have a large effect on intentions or beliefs in civic engagement.
